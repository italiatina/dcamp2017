 - How do we learn best?
 - How long before we can start building things?
 - Will we always be playing catch-up?



<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#1a6c7a" -->
## How do we deal with the culture?

 - -isms 
    - These can be intense in the software field.
    - When compunded, can pose a big, ongoing barrier to entering and remaining in the field.
 - Cultural foundations
    - You may not hold the same fond memories.
    - You may not have had the same formative experiences.
    - As a beginner it seems like a hard club to break into.

## Where is the payoff?

 - How do we market our new skills?
 - How do we market our pre-existing skills?
 - How do we avoid getting stuck?
 - How do we narrow it down?
 - How long before we can charge for our new skills?
 - There is a lot of hype around high salaries in software. Does this apply to us too?



<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#1a6c7a" -->
## Living up to the hype?

 - How to we increase our self-confidence?
 - How do we deal with leaving a career we may have enjoyed?
 - What are we "good at" now?
 - The "Shouldn't I know this?" feeling
 - Is this a stupid question?
 - It's hard to express ourselves if we haven't been steeped in the lingo.
